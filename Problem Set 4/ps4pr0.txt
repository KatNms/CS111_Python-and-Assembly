Problem 0: Reading and Response


In hindsight, I think the most preventable factor was "trying to stuff a 64-bit number into a 16-bit space."
Not to mention, the calculation with the bug had no function other than the first 40 seconds of flight, 
which made it easier to restart the system in case the countdown were to be put on hold. Given that the calculation 
was unnecessary, a "special feature" for Ariane, the input of a 64-bit number into a 16-bit space should have been 
an easy adjustment.

I agree that software bugs don't fail in the same way that a mechanical system can fail. As mentioned in the article,
software, which gets modified with each version, behaves more like an organism. It's based on human thinking in how it branches 
out and interacts with the system. Because it is fundamentally different from a mechanical system, it will fail in a different sense 
from a mechanical system.
