1. What type of statements are included in this program?
Assignment and print statements

2. In what order are the statements executed?
The statements are executed sequentially starting from "course = 111" to the last print statement "print('that is approximately', weeks, 'weeks')"

3. The variable course is incremented by 1, so it's reassigned to the value 112. The print statements displays "maybe you will take cs 112 next semester" on the screen.

4. a) The difference is that weeks is a variable and 'weeks' is a string that gets printed out by the print statement.

b) It prints 5 because it is integer division, so it disregards the fractional part of the integer, nor does it round up.

c) We could use float division, /.

5. Copy/paste code

6. EOL error in scanning literal, resulting from syntax errors

7. Changed lines to: 
print()
print('Go Terriers!')
print('pi is approximately', (22 / 7))
