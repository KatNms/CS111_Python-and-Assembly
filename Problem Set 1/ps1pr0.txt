2. I have a hybrid view of the opinion: we "don't have to settle for models at all." Although Anderson suggests that models trail behind innovation and are therefore becoming obsolete, models are useful for standarizing important ideas as well as communicating explanations. Models are especially helpful for students, encouraging skills such as graphing, visualization, and computational skills. They provide a simple environment for interactive engagement, which makes them incredibly useful in an academic setting.
