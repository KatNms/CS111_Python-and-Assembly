Problem Set 3 
Problem 0: Reading and response


I find the comparison to molecular computing in how "DNA is sometimes called the software of life"
interesting. Developing "liquid computers" (i.e. DNA and RNA) to propogate certain signals has the potential 
to help numerous people, killing malignant cells while leaving healthy cells intact.
Of the homework that we've completed thus far, I'd say that nothing really comes close to the magnitude of the work
mentioned in this article. However, we've completed assignemnts that are similar in a very simplified sense. 
For example, developing programs and debugging them is essentially how molecular circuits are being developed. Additionally,
we also use templates to complete our assignments. Similarly, Dr. Benenson says, "we build the template in the form of synthetic genes and the cell
turns them into components." We develop templates, or they are provided, and use them as building blocks for our programs. 
A concrete example of a template being used is PS 2 Prb 1. We were provided the program and asked to complete a set of tables
to visualize the execution. Another example is in our most recent lab, task 2: debugging a recursive function.
