Problem Set 6 Problem 0: Reading and Response

1. In light of the reading, I would argue that computational models, depending on how they are used, can either better society or hurt it. 
They are helpful tools that can guide institutions to make better decisions and make better products. 
For example, Powell wrote, that chemists use computer models "in the pharmaceutical industry develop better drugs by simulating the way they interact 
with their target and the body." It is undeniable that these models have helped society progress. However, a number
of models exist and choosing the one best fit for a specific institution is difficult. This can be seen with the model used
by banks, which contributed to economic disaster. In conclusion, models are simply tools. Which one is used and how it is used will 
determine its overall effect on society as a whole.
